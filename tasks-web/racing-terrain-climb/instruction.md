# Racing Terrain Climb

Build a Racing Terrain Climb as a Web game (HTML5 canvas / Phaser) in the current working directory.
This is not a prototype. It is a **complete, shippable micro-game** that could
sit on an itch.io page or Steam as a polished vertical slice.

## Core Vision

A side-scrolling physics vehicle game where the player drives over rugged
terrain, managing momentum and fuel to reach the farthest distance possible.
The vehicle bounces, tilts, and flips over hills and valleys — too much
throttle on a steep incline flips you backward; too little and you stall on
the slope. Fuel is limited and refilled at checkpoints, creating tension between
speed and conservation. Earned coins buy vehicle upgrades (engine power,
suspension, fuel capacity) and new vehicle types, each with different physics
properties. The fantasy is conquering impossible terrain through smart driving
and incremental improvement.

## What the Player Experiences

1. **Title Screen** — A rugged outdoor scene with the game name in bold blocky
   letters, a vehicle silhouette mid-jump against a sunset sky, and Play/Garage
   buttons. No a plain unstyled canvas with no background art.
2. **Stage Select** — Multiple terrain environments (countryside hills, moon
   surface, arctic ice, desert dunes) each with distinct physics properties
   (friction, gravity). Stages unlock by reaching distance milestones.
3. **Driving Physics** — The vehicle has realistic 2D physics: wheels grip
   terrain, the chassis tilts with slope angle, and momentum carries over
   crests. The player controls gas (right) and brake (left), plus tilt
   (up/down) to adjust the vehicle's angle mid-air.
4. **Fuel Management** — A fuel gauge depletes as the player drives. Running
   out stops the vehicle. Fuel canisters appear along the route at intervals.
   The tension between driving fast (burning fuel) and conserving creates
   meaningful decisions.
5. **Coins and Distance** — Coins scatter along the terrain and award currency.
   Distance is tracked as a high score. Each run ends when fuel runs out or
   the vehicle is destroyed (landing on the roof).
6. **Garage/Upgrades** — Between runs, the player spends coins on upgrades:
   engine power, fuel capacity, suspension stiffness, tyre grip. At least 3
   different vehicle types (jeep, motorcycle, monster truck) with visibly
   different sprites and handling characteristics.
7. **Distance Records** — A persistent leaderboard shows best distance per
   stage. Beating a personal record triggers a celebration effect.

## Assets

Produce the game's art through the asset workflow you were given. Generated
sprites, tiles, UI and audio belong under `public/assets/`, loaded by the
game at runtime.

Art quality is scored from what is actually on screen. A build whose visible
elements are drawn in code — solid-color rectangles, untextured geometry,
unstyled default controls — is capped well below full credit no matter how
correct the mechanics are.

## Project layout

Work in the current directory. It is your game's root — do not nest the project
inside another folder. The template you copy in already establishes the layout:

```
./
  index.html
  package.json          dev / build / typecheck scripts
  vite.config.js
  src/                  main.ts, LevelManager.ts, gameConfig.json, scenes/, chrome/
  public/assets/        images and audio the game loads at runtime
  dist/                 your production build — this is what gets evaluated
  demo_outputs/         ← your input traces (1–10 files)
```

Follow the template and asset workflow you were given; this section only adds
what the evaluator needs on top of it. Two things are required beyond a normal
build:

- a production build in `dist/`, and
- one or more replayable traces in `demo_outputs/`.

The build must complete and the built page must come up cleanly:

```
npm run build
```

The evaluator then serves `dist/` over a local static server and opens it in a
headless browser. It passes when three things hold: the page reaches the `load`
event, a `<canvas>` element is present, and no uncaught JavaScript error is
raised during startup. Serving matters — opening `dist/index.html` over `file://`
fails on module and asset loading and is not how the evaluator runs it.

Keep the first paint fast. Assets are decoded on the CPU here with no GPU, so a
handful of very large images can push the page past the load timeout; a build
that takes longer than 30 s to first paint is treated as a failed build.

## Demos

Ship **1–10 input-trace files** under `demo_outputs/`, one per demo, each named
`*.json`. The evaluator serves a fresh copy of your build per trace, replays
your trace as synthetic mouse and keyboard input at 1280×720, and records the
screen. Only the first 10 traces by filename are evaluated; recordings longer
than 20 s are sampled from a random 20 s window.

Traces are part of the deliverable, not an afterthought. A project that builds
but ships no replayable trace produces no gameplay evidence, and every
requirement that depends on observed behaviour scores 0.

### Scenarios

Normal play should start from the title screen and demonstrate the task's
core gameplay loop.
Demo playback must be deterministic. For demos that need a specific state
(a specific level, combat state, upgrade screen, result state, or late-game
setup), define named scenarios your game loads when the page is opened with a
`scenario` query parameter:

```
http://127.0.0.1:<port>/?scenario=<id>
```

When `scenario` is present the game must skip menus, set up the named state
deterministically (seed any RNG), and begin accepting input immediately.

### Coordinates

Coordinates in a trace are pixels in a **1280×720 game viewport**, measured
from the top-left of your game canvas — not from the top-left of the browser
window. The evaluator reads the canvas position and size from the page and maps
your coordinates onto it, so a canvas that is letterboxed or scaled to fit still
receives the click you intended. Author traces against your own game's
coordinate system and ignore the browser chrome.

### Trace file format

```json
{
  "scenario": "title_flow",
  "duration_frames": 360,
  "events": [
    {"frame": 30,  "type": "mouse_click", "button": "left", "x": 300, "y": 360},
    {"frame": 90,  "type": "key_press",   "keycode": "1"},
    {"frame": 180, "type": "key_press",   "keycode": "SPACE"},
    {"frame": 300, "type": "wait"}
  ]
}
```

- `scenario` — optional; omit for a normal game launch from the title screen.
- `duration_frames` — total frames to record at 30 fps; cap at **600 (20 s)**.
- `events` — time-ordered inputs. Coordinates are pixels in the 1280×720 game
  viewport (see above). Supported types:
  - `mouse_click`: `{frame, type, button: "left"|"right", x, y}`
  - `mouse_down` / `mouse_up`: `{frame, type, button: "left"|"right", x, y}` —
    use these for drag interactions: emit `mouse_down` at the start point,
    one or more `mouse_move` events along the way, and `mouse_up` at the end.
    A `mouse_click` is a `mouse_down` + `mouse_up` at the same point in tight
    succession.
  - `mouse_move`: `{frame, type, x, y}`
  - `key_press` / `key_down` / `key_up`: `{frame, type, keycode}` — keycodes:
    `A`–`Z`, `0`–`9`, `ESCAPE`, `ENTER`, `SPACE`, `TAB`, `BACKSPACE`,
    `DELETE`, `SHIFT`, `CTRL`, `ALT`, `UP`, `DOWN`, `LEFT`, `RIGHT`.

    Your game must respond to real browser keyboard events. Reading
    `event.code` (`KeyA`, `Digit1`, `Space`, `Escape`, `ArrowLeft`) is the
    reliable route; the evaluator dispatches those. A game that only listens
    for a custom in-page control will not receive these.
  - `wait`: `{frame, type}` — anchor frame, no input.

Replay must be deterministic: same trace, fresh serve, same outcome every time.
Anything time-of-day dependent, unseeded random, or reliant on network state
will not replay the same way twice and costs you the demo.
