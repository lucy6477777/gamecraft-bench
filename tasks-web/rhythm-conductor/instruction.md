# Rhythm Conductor

Build a Rhythm Conductor as a Web game (HTML5 canvas / Phaser) in the current working directory.
This is not a prototype. It is a **complete, shippable micro-game** that could
sit on an itch.io page or Steam as a polished vertical slice.

## Core Vision

The player is a battlefield conductor issuing rhythmic commands to a squad of
warriors. Each command — march, attack, defend, charge — must be tapped in a
specific rhythm pattern. Nail the timing and your troops execute with power and
precision; fumble it and they stumble into disarray. Enemies advance in waves,
and the player must read the battlefield and choose the right command at the
right tempo. Between battles, the squad levels up and unlocks new command
patterns with more complex rhythms.

## What the Player Experiences

1. **Title Screen** — A war-drum themed menu with the game name in bold
   military-style lettering, a campaign button, and marching silhouettes in
   the background. No a plain unstyled canvas with no background art.
2. **Command Input** — The bottom of the screen shows a rhythm bar. The player
   taps 4-beat patterns (e.g., tap-tap-hold-tap for "Attack") in time with a
   metronome pulse. Visual feedback shows timing accuracy per beat.
3. **Squad Response** — When a command is executed successfully, the squad
   performs the action with a power level proportional to timing accuracy.
   Perfect timing triggers a "Fever" version with bonus effects (extra damage,
   wider shield, faster march).
4. **Enemy Waves** — Enemies march from the right in formation. Different enemy
   types require different counter-strategies: shielded foes need the "Charge"
   command to break through; archers need "Defend" to block volleys; swarms
   need "Attack" for area damage.
5. **Battlefield View** — A side-scrolling battlefield shows the player's squad
   on the left and enemies on the right. Units animate their actions in sync
   with the rhythm. Health bars float above each unit group.
6. **Upgrades** — Between missions, the player spends earned resources to
   upgrade unit types (stronger attacks, faster movement) or unlock new command
   patterns (a 6-beat "Rally" that heals, a syncopated "Ambush" for critical
   hits).
7. **Boss Encounters** — Boss enemies have their own rhythm patterns that
   interfere with the player's commands. The player must maintain their own
   tempo while adapting to the boss's disruption beats.

## Assets

Produce the game's art through the asset workflow you were given. Generated
sprites, tiles, UI and audio belong under `public/assets/`, loaded by the
game at runtime.

Art quality is scored from what is actually on screen. A build whose visible
elements are drawn in code — solid-color rectangles, untextured geometry,
unstyled default controls — is capped well below full credit no matter how
correct the mechanics are.

## Project layout

Work in the current directory. It is your game's root — do not nest the project
inside another folder. The template you copy in already establishes the layout:

```
./
  index.html
  package.json          dev / build / typecheck scripts
  vite.config.js
  src/                  main.ts, LevelManager.ts, gameConfig.json, scenes/, chrome/
  public/assets/        images and audio the game loads at runtime
  dist/                 your production build — this is what gets evaluated
  demo_outputs/         ← your input traces (1–10 files)
```

Follow the template and asset workflow you were given; this section only adds
what the evaluator needs on top of it. Two things are required beyond a normal
build:

- a production build in `dist/`, and
- one or more replayable traces in `demo_outputs/`.

The build must complete and the built page must come up cleanly:

```
npm run build
```

The evaluator then serves `dist/` over a local static server and opens it in a
headless browser. It passes when three things hold: the page reaches the `load`
event, a `<canvas>` element is present, and no uncaught JavaScript error is
raised during startup. Serving matters — opening `dist/index.html` over `file://`
fails on module and asset loading and is not how the evaluator runs it.

Keep the first paint fast. Assets are decoded on the CPU here with no GPU, so a
handful of very large images can push the page past the load timeout; a build
that takes longer than 30 s to first paint is treated as a failed build.

## Demos

Ship **1–10 input-trace files** under `demo_outputs/`, one per demo, each named
`*.json`. The evaluator serves a fresh copy of your build per trace, replays
your trace as synthetic mouse and keyboard input at 1280×720, and records the
screen. Only the first 10 traces by filename are evaluated; recordings longer
than 20 s are sampled from a random 20 s window.

Traces are part of the deliverable, not an afterthought. A project that builds
but ships no replayable trace produces no gameplay evidence, and every
requirement that depends on observed behaviour scores 0.

### Scenarios

Normal play should start from the title screen and demonstrate the task's
core gameplay loop.
Demo playback must be deterministic. For demos that need a specific state
(a specific level, combat state, upgrade screen, result state, or late-game
setup), define named scenarios your game loads when the page is opened with a
`scenario` query parameter:

```
http://127.0.0.1:<port>/?scenario=<id>
```

When `scenario` is present the game must skip menus, set up the named state
deterministically (seed any RNG), and begin accepting input immediately.

### Coordinates

Coordinates in a trace are pixels in a **1280×720 game viewport**, measured
from the top-left of your game canvas — not from the top-left of the browser
window. The evaluator reads the canvas position and size from the page and maps
your coordinates onto it, so a canvas that is letterboxed or scaled to fit still
receives the click you intended. Author traces against your own game's
coordinate system and ignore the browser chrome.

### Trace file format

```json
{
  "scenario": "title_flow",
  "duration_frames": 360,
  "events": [
    {"frame": 30,  "type": "mouse_click", "button": "left", "x": 300, "y": 360},
    {"frame": 90,  "type": "key_press",   "keycode": "1"},
    {"frame": 180, "type": "key_press",   "keycode": "SPACE"},
    {"frame": 300, "type": "wait"}
  ]
}
```

- `scenario` — optional; omit for a normal game launch from the title screen.
- `duration_frames` — total frames to record at 30 fps; cap at **600 (20 s)**.
- `events` — time-ordered inputs. Coordinates are pixels in the 1280×720 game
  viewport (see above). Supported types:
  - `mouse_click`: `{frame, type, button: "left"|"right", x, y}`
  - `mouse_down` / `mouse_up`: `{frame, type, button: "left"|"right", x, y}` —
    use these for drag interactions: emit `mouse_down` at the start point,
    one or more `mouse_move` events along the way, and `mouse_up` at the end.
    A `mouse_click` is a `mouse_down` + `mouse_up` at the same point in tight
    succession.
  - `mouse_move`: `{frame, type, x, y}`
  - `key_press` / `key_down` / `key_up`: `{frame, type, keycode}` — keycodes:
    `A`–`Z`, `0`–`9`, `ESCAPE`, `ENTER`, `SPACE`, `TAB`, `BACKSPACE`,
    `DELETE`, `SHIFT`, `CTRL`, `ALT`, `UP`, `DOWN`, `LEFT`, `RIGHT`.

    Your game must respond to real browser keyboard events. Reading
    `event.code` (`KeyA`, `Digit1`, `Space`, `Escape`, `ArrowLeft`) is the
    reliable route; the evaluator dispatches those. A game that only listens
    for a custom in-page control will not receive these.
  - `wait`: `{frame, type}` — anchor frame, no input.

Replay must be deterministic: same trace, fresh serve, same outcome every time.
Anything time-of-day dependent, unseeded random, or reliant on network state
will not replay the same way twice and costs you the demo.
