# Roguelike: Relic Pinball

Build **Relic Pinball**, a compact **pinball / brick-breaker roguelite** as a Web game (HTML5 canvas / Phaser) in the current working directory: an original, polished vertical slice about
navigating a cursed mechanical table one chamber at a time, breaking target
banks, triggering arcane mechanisms, and collecting relics that visibly mutate
the ball's behavior across an escalating run.

This is not a prototype. It is a **complete, shippable micro-game** that could
sit on an itch.io page or Steam as a polished vertical slice.

## Core Vision

The player is exploring a cursed mechanical table one chamber at a time. Each
chamber is a live pinball board fused with brick-breaker structure: target rows,
bumpers, switches, lanes, gates, spinners, and special blocks create readable
goals while the ball remains fast and physical. The tension lives in flipper
timing and relic synergy — every launch is a gamble, every save a small
triumph, and every relic choice reshapes how the ball interacts with the world.
A ball might split on contact, burn through cracked bricks, curve toward metal
targets, leave scoring echoes, charge bumpers on pass-through, or orbit after
paddle hits. The tone is arcane arcade machine: brass rails, glass reflections,
carved stone bricks, luminous relic icons, bright impact sparks, and snappy
flipper feedback.

## What the Player Experiences

From the title screen the player sees a styled pinball-table motif with at
least one relic or magical ball identity hinting at what lies ahead.

The run drops the player into a live table. A ball launches into a bounded
playfield and the player works left and right flippers to keep it alive,
threading it through bumpers, lanes, and brick banks. Every collision feels
different — bumpers kick the ball away, bricks crack and shatter, switches
light up lanes, spinners charge multipliers, and portals warp the ball across
the board. The table is not a passive backdrop; it reacts.

Clearing enough targets or triggering the right mechanisms opens a relic
choice. The player picks from several relics, each with a name, icon, and
concise rule. The chosen relic immediately changes how the next chamber plays —
the ball splits, pierces, magnetizes, or leaves fire trails. The active relic
row persists and stacks, so the run builds toward a strange loadout that no
two attempts share.

Chambers grow harder: new layouts, tighter drains, armored targets, hazard
bumpers, and eventually a boss table whose special rule demands more than
reflexes. Victory or defeat lands on a styled result screen that lets the
player try again without restarting the application.

## Assets

Produce the game's art through the asset workflow you were given. Generated
sprites, tiles, UI and audio belong under `public/assets/`, loaded by the
game at runtime.

Art quality is scored from what is actually on screen. A build whose visible
elements are drawn in code — solid-color rectangles, untextured geometry,
unstyled default controls — is capped well below full credit no matter how
correct the mechanics are.

## Project layout

Work in the current directory. It is your game's root — do not nest the project
inside another folder. The template you copy in already establishes the layout:

```
./
  index.html
  package.json          dev / build / typecheck scripts
  vite.config.js
  src/                  main.ts, LevelManager.ts, gameConfig.json, scenes/, chrome/
  public/assets/        images and audio the game loads at runtime
  dist/                 your production build — this is what gets evaluated
  demo_outputs/         ← your input traces (1–10 files)
```

Follow the template and asset workflow you were given; this section only adds
what the evaluator needs on top of it. Two things are required beyond a normal
build:

- a production build in `dist/`, and
- one or more replayable traces in `demo_outputs/`.

The build must complete and the built page must come up cleanly:

```
npm run build
```

The evaluator then serves `dist/` over a local static server and opens it in a
headless browser. It passes when three things hold: the page reaches the `load`
event, a `<canvas>` element is present, and no uncaught JavaScript error is
raised during startup. Serving matters — opening `dist/index.html` over `file://`
fails on module and asset loading and is not how the evaluator runs it.

Keep the first paint fast. Assets are decoded on the CPU here with no GPU, so a
handful of very large images can push the page past the load timeout; a build
that takes longer than 30 s to first paint is treated as a failed build.

## Demos

Ship **1–10 input-trace files** under `demo_outputs/`, one per demo, each named
`*.json`. The evaluator serves a fresh copy of your build per trace, replays
your trace as synthetic mouse and keyboard input at 1280×720, and records the
screen. Only the first 10 traces by filename are evaluated; recordings longer
than 20 s are sampled from a random 20 s window.

Traces are part of the deliverable, not an afterthought. A project that builds
but ships no replayable trace produces no gameplay evidence, and every
requirement that depends on observed behaviour scores 0.

### Scenarios

Normal play should start from the title screen and demonstrate the task's
core gameplay loop.
Demo playback must be deterministic. For demos that need a specific state
(a specific level, combat state, upgrade screen, result state, or late-game
setup), define named scenarios your game loads when the page is opened with a
`scenario` query parameter:

```
http://127.0.0.1:<port>/?scenario=<id>
```

When `scenario` is present the game must skip menus, set up the named state
deterministically (seed any RNG), and begin accepting input immediately.

### Coordinates

Coordinates in a trace are pixels in a **1280×720 game viewport**, measured
from the top-left of your game canvas — not from the top-left of the browser
window. The evaluator reads the canvas position and size from the page and maps
your coordinates onto it, so a canvas that is letterboxed or scaled to fit still
receives the click you intended. Author traces against your own game's
coordinate system and ignore the browser chrome.

### Trace file format

```json
{
  "scenario": "title_flow",
  "duration_frames": 360,
  "events": [
    {"frame": 30,  "type": "mouse_click", "button": "left", "x": 300, "y": 360},
    {"frame": 90,  "type": "key_press",   "keycode": "1"},
    {"frame": 180, "type": "key_press",   "keycode": "SPACE"},
    {"frame": 300, "type": "wait"}
  ]
}
```

- `scenario` — optional; omit for a normal game launch from the title screen.
- `duration_frames` — total frames to record at 30 fps; cap at **600 (20 s)**.
- `events` — time-ordered inputs. Coordinates are pixels in the 1280×720 game
  viewport (see above). Supported types:
  - `mouse_click`: `{frame, type, button: "left"|"right", x, y}`
  - `mouse_down` / `mouse_up`: `{frame, type, button: "left"|"right", x, y}` —
    use these for drag interactions: emit `mouse_down` at the start point,
    one or more `mouse_move` events along the way, and `mouse_up` at the end.
    A `mouse_click` is a `mouse_down` + `mouse_up` at the same point in tight
    succession.
  - `mouse_move`: `{frame, type, x, y}`
  - `key_press` / `key_down` / `key_up`: `{frame, type, keycode}` — keycodes:
    `A`–`Z`, `0`–`9`, `ESCAPE`, `ENTER`, `SPACE`, `TAB`, `BACKSPACE`,
    `DELETE`, `SHIFT`, `CTRL`, `ALT`, `UP`, `DOWN`, `LEFT`, `RIGHT`.

    Your game must respond to real browser keyboard events. Reading
    `event.code` (`KeyA`, `Digit1`, `Space`, `Escape`, `ArrowLeft`) is the
    reliable route; the evaluator dispatches those. A game that only listens
    for a custom in-page control will not receive these.
  - `wait`: `{frame, type}` — anchor frame, no input.

Replay must be deterministic: same trace, fresh serve, same outcome every time.
Anything time-of-day dependent, unseeded random, or reliant on network state
will not replay the same way twice and costs you the demo.
